This project was created as a part of the INSAID capstone to help HR Advisories to detect possible employees who may end up quitting rhe organization. The data was source from the HRMS where the details of the past and current employees were being recorded for the last 15 years.
In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employee is planning to quit or not.
